# Overview
This repository contains multiple solvers for the different puzzles found in 
the game Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes.  

This completely ruins the fun of the game. These solvers were made more for 
the fun of solving a few simple programing puzzles.  

Each solver works by asking the user for the information available from the 
diffuser's point of view. After all relevant information has been entered the 
solution will be printed out.  

Currently solved:

- Passwords (`passwords.py`)
